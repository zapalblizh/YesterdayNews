## Deployed Version of the Project
https://yesterdaynews.netlify.app/

> **Note:** Updates news articles based on prior mentioned features every day at 00:00 on UTC time.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22 (see `.nvmrc`)
- A free [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org) API key or any news API key provider

> **Note:** This project is designed for local development only, however it can be deployed to any static site hosting provider, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zapalblizh/YesterdayNews.git
cd YesterdayNews
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Running locally

```bash
npm run start
```

Opens a dev server at `http://localhost:8080` with live reload. News is fetched from NewsAPI at build time each time Eleventy rebuilds.

## Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run start` | Start dev server with file watching (Eleventy + CSS + JS) |
| `npm run build` | Production build (Eleventy + minified CSS) |
| `npm run clean:site` | Remove `_site/` and `_temp/` build artifacts |

## Modifying API configuration

News fetching is configured in `src/_data/news.js`. By default it fetches:

- Category: `technology`
- Language: `en`
- Page size: `100` (filtered down to articles with images)
  - For free API key on NewsAPI, 100 is the max allowed

To change category, language, or other parameters, edit the `url.searchParams` calls in that file. 

Available options are documented in the [NewsAPI docs](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines).

## Upcoming Features

- Light/Dark Mode custom configuration
- Easier customization of news sources
- Button to trigger a fresh fetch with different config
  - Will be a commented out feature
